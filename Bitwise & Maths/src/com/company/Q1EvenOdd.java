/* Traditional Approach (Finding Remainder) :

Whenever we and(&) any number(n) with 1 , we get that number(n) itself.
Eg : n=18  1 0 0 1 0
         & 1 1 1 1 1
        == 1 0 0 1 0

        Binary : 2^5 2^4 2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0
      ......     32   16  8   4   2   1⬅LSB
      ......     ⬆____Even nos.____⬆   ⬆(odd no.)

      Last bit of Binary number is called as LSB i.e. Least Significant Bit

      So, if LSB is 1 ===> Number is Odd
          if LSB is 0 ===> Number is Even

          n=18  1 0 0 1 0
              & 1 1 1 1 1
             == 1 0 0 1 0<=LSB is 0       ==> n = 18 = Even

          n=17  1 0 0 0 1
              & 1 1 1 1 1
             == 1 0 0 0 1<=LSB is 1       ==> n = 17 = Odd
