// Checkout [Ceiling Of A Number](https://github.com/YourOwnItsMeDHC/DSA-Let-s-Fire-/blob/master/Binary%20Search/Basic/src/com/company/CeilingOfAnumber.java) , it's similar to these "744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target"
// Only change is that , in Ceiling Question we were finding element greater than or equal to target , 
// but here we are finding only greater than target and not equal to target and there is on wrap around condition.
